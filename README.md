MARKET BASKET ANALYSIS USING APRIORI ALGORITHM



All of us have done e-shopping right? We go to the site for buying a particular thing and come out with a lot more than what we wished to buy, right? Ever thought how the retailers manage to tempT us into buying stuff that we actually did not intend to buy in the first place?

Let's uncover the secret today.

We live in the era of e-commerce and digital marketing, We hav even small scale businesses going online as the opportunities are endless.

Since a huge chunk of the people who have access to internet is switching to onlline shopping, large retailers are actively searching for ways to increase their profit.

Market Basket analysis is one such key techniques used by large retailers to uncover relationships between items, which can in turn help them make profit:

Still Confused ?

Let me try and make it clear with an example:

Customers who buy bread are more likely to buy jam as well, similarly people who buy laptops are likely to buy laptop bags as well. Finding these kind of relationships between items and ensuring that they are placed correctly in the market recommendations so that the chance of the purchase of the second item is effectively increased.

Now lets say we find out that people who buy bread buy jam most of the time, how can we make them buy a third item say eggs? what if we place an offer that they can't deny? Lets give them a discount of 30% on eggs, they will be tempted to buy the eggs right?

This is how the market basket analysis work, we find relationships between items so that the retailers can make necessary arrangements and offers to ensure that the person who is buying one item buys the related items as well.

Hope this makes sense.
